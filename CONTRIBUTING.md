## Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to a KnuEdge open source project! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. Our IT staff follow the [KnuEgde IT Code of Ethics](https://confluence.intellisis.com/display/ITc/IT+Code+of+Ethics) and all contributors should do the same.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE), and its [README](README.md).

If you have any questions or want to read more, check out the [KnuEdge Open Source Policy repository](https://bitbucket.intellisis.com/projects/ITS/repos/open-source-policy/browse), or just [shoot us an email](mailto:opensource@knuedge.com).
